### Developing in the Sandbox

The code includes a sandbox SvelteKit app that you can run to test the library. Nothing in the sandbox will be included in the packaged library, only files in `src/lib` will be included.

To start the sandbox, simply run:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev --open
```
