# @catalyst-monitor/nextjs

This is the core library for [Catalyst](https://www.catalystmonitor.com). It contains the base business logic for recording and handling data to send to Catalyst for both server and client environments.

The best way to instrument this library is to use a framework specific library that handles instrumentation neatly for you. Please check out the [https://www.catalystmonitor.com/docs](docs) to find installation instructions for your framework.
