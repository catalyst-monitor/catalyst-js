# @catalyst-monitor/core

## This library is deprecated

Just want to install Catalyst? Check out the up-to-date information at [https://www.catalystmonitor.com/docs](https://www.catalystmonitor.com/docs).

## Migration

Please migrate to `@catalyst-monitor/web` and/or `@catalyst-monitor/server` for the client and server respectively.

- `@catalyst-monitor/web`: https://github.com/catalyst-monitor/catalyst-js/tree/main/packages/web
- `@catalyst-monitor/server`: https://github.com/catalyst-monitor/catalyst-js/tree/main/packages/server

Both feature a nicer interface, while `@catalyst-monitor/server` uses OpenTelemetry and can easily be used with tools other than Catalyst.
