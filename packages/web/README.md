# Catalyst Web Instrumentation Library

`@catalyst-monitor/web` is the core web instrumentation library for [Catalyst](https://www.catalystmonitor.com). It contains some common instrumentation for all web environments as well as the building blocks for other instrumentation libraries.

The best way to instrument this library is to use a framework specific library that handles instrumentation neatly for you. Please check out the [https://www.catalystmonitor.com/docs](docs) to find installation instructions for your framework.
